## Django Project
#### Assignment Description
Develop a web application API using Python and the Django framework that can perform CRUD operations on a MySQL database. You are free to choose the type of data the application will store (e.g. users, cars, animals, etc.). The data should be complex enough, containing different types of values (Strings, ints, Booleans, etc.).

`[40%]`	All CRUD operations are working as intended (e.g. the right data is retrieved while using an index, data is being deleted by a criteria, retrieve one or multiple records).

`[10%]`	The application is connecting to the right database. 

`[10%]`	The data is complex: it contains at least one index (unique entry); has at least 3 types of variables and there are sufficient entries already in the database;

`[10%]` Code is readable: consistency, right indentation, comments.

`[20%]`	The application is accompanied by a short report (max. 500 words) or a ReadMe file. The
	report should explain the developing process of the application.

`[10%]`	Creativity: Do your own research and add any other functionality to your application. (e.g.
	multiple variable types – Boolean, array, array, etc.; basic front-end; database
	complexity; multiple objects, etc.)
